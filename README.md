# TrieDataStructure
This Trie tree implementation in C# populates our tree with the words(dictionary) found in the customly specified text file.
Searching through another specified text file, it reports the number of words(and which) that exist in our data structure.
Search words that are lengthwise a bit too short compared to existing(registered in tree) words are modified with our 
Autocomplete method.  

Goal of this project is to be able to quickly reTRIEve words(for now) and modify them with autocompletion, autocorrection and more...
